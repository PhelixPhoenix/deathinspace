REPAIRING OBJECTS One spare part repairs one condition point. BROKEN OBJECTS First condition point costs spare parts equal to object’s maximum condition. REPAIR TIME 1d6 hours per used component for electronics and weapons. 1d20 hours per vehicle part used for vehicles and spacecraft. Stefan McIntyre (Order #34103687) COMBAT • When someone makes a hostile action, they start the turn order. • After a participant has acted, they choose who acts next. If last in round, they choose who starts next round. The attack roll is 1d20+BDY (melee) or TEC (ranged). Attacks hit if roll is equal to or above target’s defense rating. RISKY ATTACK Roll a normal attack roll: HIT: Deal an extra damage die. MISS: Target gets an immediate counterattack and takes over choice of who acts next. CRITICAL HITS On a natural 20, the attack deals an extra damage die. REDUCING CONDITION IN COMBAT After combat, roll 1d6 for each used weapon or item. On a 1, it loses one condition. An attack causing maximum damage reduces condition of one of defender’s items by one. DEATH AND HEALING At zero or less hit points, roll BDY check: SUCCESS: Stabilized but unconscious until rest. FAILURE: Person is dead (roll on Death in Space table). Resting a full night restores 1d8+BDY hit points. Resting at a safe haven restores all hit points. MORALE Roll 2d6 for opponent or ally. If above morale rating, they try to parley or flee. SPACECRAFT CONFRONTATIONS Turn order starts when a spacecraft makes a hostile action. Crews act as groups in the turn order and all crew members must act before choosing the next ship to act. The last acting ship can not start the next round. DISTANCES DETECTION: First detection. IDENTIFICATION: Scan and identify. FIRING: Ranged attacks. BOARDING: Can board other ship. MOVEMENT PCs move all other ships one step on their pilot’s turn. Non-player ships move one step on their turns. RISKY MANEUVERS SVY check. Failure costs one fuel. Required for most piloting actions in a confrontation. FLEEING Outside hostilities, must get beyond detection distance. In hostilities, opposed SVY check for all ships. Flees from ships with lower results. FIRING TEC check. Hits if equal to or above target’s defense rating. FRAME RECOVERY Regains 1d6×10% when all is calm. One night in safe port regains all frame damage. REDUCING CONDITION After the confrontation, roll 1d6 per person who did a risky maneuver or used a module. On a 1 or more, the ship loses one condition. Maximum damage in an attack reduces target’s condition by one.</span></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ODmBS5DHEcRTl8GE":3},"flags":{}}
