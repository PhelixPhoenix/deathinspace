{"_id":"10AdWoPiNFuvjMeT","name":"Spacecraft Confrontations","content":"<p>SPACECRAFT CONFRONTATIONS</p>\n<p>Combat between spacecraft is unusual, due to the large risk of losing your ship or having to pay for expensive repairs. The hesitance to destroy valuable parts has resulted in an unspoken agreement, with confrontations between spacecraft instead often ending in boarding or flight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1>Rounds and turn order</h1>\n<p>Strict turn order starts when a spacecraft makes a hostile action. Turns are longer than in personal combat, about ten minutes. The crew members on each space spacecraft act in the order they wish before choosing which ship acts next. If they are last in the round, they must chose another ship to start the next round.</p>\n<h1>Non-Hostile Situation</h1>\n<p>Until a ship starts hostilities, go back and forth between the player spacecraft and other spacecraft and let them do something one at a time.</p>\n<h1>Hostile Situation</h1>\n<p>WHen someone makes a hostile action, like firing or attempting to board, strict turn order starts. If unlear, determine who begins with an opposed SVY check for all involved.</p>\n<h1>Actions on a spacecraft</h1>\n<p>Anyone onboard a ship can take an action when that ship acts in the turn order. Some actions require specific modules. For example:</p>\n<h2>General Actions:</h2>\n<p>piloting, fleeing, pushing engine, setting up defenses, writing a final goodbye note, jumping between ships.</p>\n<h2>Modules Required:</h2>\n<p>hostile boarding, gunning, jamming communications, hacking systems. </p>\n<h1>Risky Maneuvers</h1>\n<p>Risky maneuvers are reqired for most piloting actions in a confrontation. They are resolved with a SVY check. Failure costs one fuel. With a successful risky maneuver, the pilot can move two distance steps in an action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn order starts when a spacecraft makes a hostile action.</li>\n<li>Crews act as groups in the turn order and all crew members must act before choosing the next ship to act.</li>\n<li>The last acting ship can not start the next round.</li>\n<li>DISTANCES DETECTION: First detection.</li>\n<li>IDENTIFICATION: Scan and identify.</li>\n<li>FIRING: Ranged attacks.</li>\n<li>BOARDING: Can board other ship.</li>\n<li>MOVEMENT PCs move all other ships one step on their pilot’s turn.</li>\n<li>Non-player ships move one step on their turns.</li>\n<li>RISKY MANEUVERS SVY check. Failure costs one fuel. Required for most piloting actions in a confrontation.</li>\n<li>FLEEING Outside hostilities, must get beyond detection distance. In hostilities, opposed SVY check for all ships. Flees from ships with lower results.</li>\n<li>FIRING TEC check. Hits if equal to or above target’s defense rating.</li>\n<li>FRAME RECOVERY Regains 1d6×10% when all is calm. One night in safe port regains all frame damage.</li>\n<li>REDUCING CONDITION After the confrontation, roll 1d6 per person who did a risky maneuver or used a module. On a 1 or more, the ship loses one condition. Maximum damage in an attack reduces target’s condition by one.</li>\n</ul>","folder":"8LcXoQSC6uVXk7Xj","sort":0,"permission":{"default":3,"ODmBS5DHEcRTl8GE":3},"flags":{}}

Green and blue, but not electric. Not neon. No. These greens and blues are hues and depths only modded eyes can truly appreciate. @Actor[AdlTvzw5PVaNHvMh]{HINA TSURUTSURU} grows more and more electric on the approach. Their knees bounce. Their eyes shift from one thing to another, unsure as to what could be worthy of their attention now that they knew @Actor[NqirEJx5sPNn9vqQ]{Airi Bakshi (Hina's Partner)} would be in sight soon. Nothing. Nothing is the answer. Hina had been thinking, planning, arranging this very moment for years. Now that it was here Hina wasn't sure if they were ready for this new life. On a planet, with gravity, with Airi their tender love. Hina was staring at their hands as the ship lands, they hardly notice. Airi almost has to bend down and wave before Hina realizes that this moment is real. Its not the dream they were just having in the @Actor[05VmnYTEEBtt0pyK]{Nirvana}. Hina shakes as they cry a deep sobbing cry one can only have in the arms of their soulmate. </p>\n<p>From under the canopy Hina and Airi wave to the crew of the Nirvana, and hopes it won't be for the last time because having friends and someone to love you is about all one could ask for in the void.</p>\n<p> </p>","img":null,"folder":"ZoLkJpSRmHtofj5S","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ODmBS5DHEcRTl8GE":3},"flags":{}}
