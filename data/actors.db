This species is particularly guarded around this topic as there have been times in the past when they&rsquo;ve been almost eradicated by others who discovered the meta-entity.

These spots are light-sensitive biological sensors, making this a highly visual species. The jellyfish and meta-entity communicate amongst each other using a complex visual language with these sensors.</p>\n<p>The jellyfish communicate with other species that use visual/non-audible communication methods by forming images (animated or otherwise) the reflect the target species' language.

These organs are sentient to the point that they develop distinct personalities in their journeys. These personalities are another form of knowledge that the meta-entity absorbs upon their return.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the jellyfish have distinct personalities, they think of themselves as part of a collective and want to be referred to as such with collective/plural pronouns. This is critical to their sociocultural identity.</p>\n<p>The jellyfish survive and traverse the universe in special antigrav pods. The pods seal up into a nigh impregnable travel mode for the long journey across deep space and return to their standard discovery/research mode when they have reached their destination.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I want to leave the details around the meta-entity undetermined for now and see how or if it develops in play. This species is particularly guarded around this topic as there have been times in the past when they&rsquo;ve been almost eradicated by others who discovered the meta-entity. To almost everyone in the universe, these are just mysterious little guys you encounter occasionally and have no idea where they came from.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Communication</em></p>\n<p>The jellyfish have spots on their bell that can be freely manipulated to form images and expressions. These spots are light-sensitive biological sensors, making this a highly visual species. The jellyfish and meta-entity communicate amongst each other using a complex visual language with these sensors.</p>\n<p>The jellyfish communicate with other species that use visual/non-audible communication methods by forming images (animated or otherwise) the reflect the target species' language. The antigrav pods are equipped with special translators for audio-based communication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"OutlineElement Ltr SCXW254637239 BCX0\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;
