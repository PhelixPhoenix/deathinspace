These organs are sentient to the point that they develop distinct personalities in their journeys. These personalities are another form of knowledge that the meta-entity absorbs upon their return.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the jellyfish have distinct personalities, they think of themselves as part of a collective and want to be referred to as such with collective/plural pronouns. This is critical to their sociocultural identity.</p>\n<p>The jellyfish survive and traverse the universe in special antigrav pods.

This species is particularly guarded around this topic as there have been times in the past when they&rsquo;ve been almost eradicated by others who discovered the meta-entity. To almost everyone in the universe, these are just mysterious little guys you encounter occasionally and have no idea where they came from.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Communication</em></p>\n<p>The jellyfish have spots on their bell that can be freely manipulated to form images and expressions. These spots are light-sensitive biological sensors, making this a highly visual species. The jellyfish and meta-entity communicate amongst each other using a complex visual language with these sensors.</p>\n<p>The jellyfish communicate with other species that use visual/non-audible communication methods by forming images (animated or otherwise) the reflect the target species' language.
